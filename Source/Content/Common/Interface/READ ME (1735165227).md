# UI Creation Files
These assets are mainly used by the **Main Menu** and **Pause Menu** demos.

# UI Style
You will notice that they include an image for a button, which uses "9 slicing" technology to maintain the aspect ratio of the edges regardless of their scale, and a **UI Style** file called "Buttons" that serves exactly to make such settings. This file also defines default behaviors for buttons, such as what happens when you hover or click on them, changing colors and playing sounds. Later, the demo scenes I mentioned link this **UI Style** file to the **"UI Element"** components so that it defines their appearance and behavior as well.

# Localization
Another interesting observation that you can make is that there is a script called "Localization" in this folder, with codes that help in the **Translation** of the game into multiple languages, as well as a dictionary that maps all the terms used in this demo to **English and Portuguese**. There are many different ways to make a Location system, so this is just a suggested use case. For more details on how they are used, explore the Entities that have components of type **UI Elements** and display text. You will see this mainly in the scenes mentioned above.
