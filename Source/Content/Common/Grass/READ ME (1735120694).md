# Grass Shader
This section of our example project is quite interesting, however it may be a bit advanced if you have no experience with shaders and GLSL.

If you go to our particle example, in one of them you will see that the ground has grass and that this grass moves with the wind.

This is a very common simulation in game development and can be easily done through small modifications in the shader through which the 3D meshes are rendered on the screen. Precisely because it is something very useful and common in game development, we have here a simple example of how this is done.

You will see that this folder has a mesh for some slices of grass ("Grass Blades") and also a material to give them color and texture. So far so good and there is nothing new.

But you will also see that this folder **has a shader called Grass Shader** and, if you select the material, you will see that in the first options this Grass Shader will be selected as a "Shader Override". This means that every time the engine renders meshes that use this material, it will not use the Default Shader, but rather the provided Override Shader.

Our grass shader is very simple, practically an identical copy of the default Cave shader. The only difference is that **in the vertex shader** we apply a random movement to the vertices on top of our grass. Using sine and cosine operations and also the timer that is provided to the shader.
