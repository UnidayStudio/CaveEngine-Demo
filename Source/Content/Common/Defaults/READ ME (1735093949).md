# Cave Default Files

This folder contains some "Default" Assets from the Cave engine. They are automatically added as soon as you create a new Project and I recommend that you keep them somewhere in your files, since if you delete them **or rename them**, some features may stop working correctly. This is because Cave refers to these Assets, through their names, when there is no other option available.

**For example:** When you add a new mesh in the 3D View (Shift + A > Mesh), Cave will create this entity with a **Mesh Component** that uses the mesh called "Default Cube" and the material "Default Material". If they are not found, you will see that nothing will appear in the scene (even though the Entity was added normally).

<div class="red">
So avoid deleting or renaming these assets!

However, you can move these files to other folders in your project and everything will continue to work.
