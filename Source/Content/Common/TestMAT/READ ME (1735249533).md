# Test Material
You will find a material called **"TestMAT"** that can be applied to any surface to define how it will look.

A surface, in this case, means a **Mesh**, typically present in:
* **Mesh Component**: The main "mesh" component of the Cave, which can be added to an Entity.
* **Particle Component**: Inherits from the **Mesh Component** and allows you to create Particles from a mesh and a material.

-------

This material uses the **Standard Shader** of the Engine and has a texture to define its values ​​of:
1. **Albedo**: Main color.
2. **Metallic**: How "metallic" each part of the surface is.
3. **Roughness**: How "rough" each part of the surface is. 4. [**Normal Map**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping): To indicate the "direction" that each part of the surface points.

The default Cave material uses [Physically Based Rendering (PBR)](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renderiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_baseada_em_f%C3%ADsica) and you can learn more about it by clicking this link.

# Tips about Materials:

* You can change the material of a **Mesh Component** by selecting the entity and changing it in the "Material" dropdown.

* You can also click and drag a Material directly from the **Asset Browser** to this Dropdown.

* Alternatively, you can click and drag a Material from the **Asset Browser** directly to an **Entity in the 3D View**.

* If the Entity has more than one **Mesh Component**, the material will only be applied to the first one.

* **EXTRA:** To speed up the creation of New Materials, you can drag **a Texture** from the **Asset Browser** directly onto an **Entity in the 3D View** and Cave will automatically create a new material for you. Just be careful not to accidentally create multiple copies of a material for the same texture.
