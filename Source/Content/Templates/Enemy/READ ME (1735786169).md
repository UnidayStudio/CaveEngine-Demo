# Enemy Template
This is a simple template with our character "Proto" in red paint applied (via Mesh Component) to simulate an enemy appearance.

Its logic uses the **Finite State Machines** from the basement to facilitate the flow, alternating between "stopped" and "walking" states in patrol mode. You can expand these states however you see fit!
