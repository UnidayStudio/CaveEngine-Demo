# Main Menu Demo
You have reached our main menu example. Here you will find a simple, yet extremely functional menu with a variety of options to help you get your bearings and inspire you to create your own game menus.

If you start the game in the Main Menu scene, you will see that you will have several options in the menu, including exiting the game, playing the other demos of this project, which will take you to another menu where you can choose between several buttons and each one will redirect you to the respective scenes, or you can go back and continue browsing the menu demo.

# Language System
An interesting example that this project has is that in the main menu you can go to the "Language" option and change the language of all the interface texts, alternating between English and Portuguese. I have already mentioned this localization system in the Common folder here in our project, but it is important to remember that this is one of the many ways you can create translation systems in your game.

# Data Saving
Another example you will find is saving and loading files, one of which is right here in the menu and is very simple, allowing you to increase or decrease an integer and save and load it to disk. You can see more details about how this works in the callbacks when the user clicks the Save and Load buttons, respectively.

Note that in the Save and Load example we use Cave's own APIs to get folders and files, create directories, etc.
