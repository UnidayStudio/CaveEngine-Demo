# Online Game Sample
This demo scene is designed to showcase the networking capabilities of Cave, enabling you to create online multiplayer games. When playing this scene, you'll notice that the game first asks if you'd like to be the host of the match (i.e., the server where other players will connect) or the client (which connects to another host). In either case, you can control a character in a top-down view, chosen for ease of multiplayer testing, and observe other connected players moving around the map.

# How to Test the Demo?
<div class="green">
Obviously, to test the Online Game, you'll need more than one game instance running to interact with each other.
</div>

The first instance must **necessarily** be the **Host (Server)**, while the others act as **Clients**, connecting to the Host.

In Cave, you can create as many independent instances of the game as you need by following these steps: 
- **Go to the Settings Tab > Game > Test your Game as a Runtime** 
- Finally, click the **Save and Run Standalone Player** button.

You can also run one of these instances directly in the editor by pressing F5 as usual. Then, release the editor controls (F3) and follow the steps above to create additional external instances of the game.

# About the Network System
Cave's multiplayer system is extremely simple. In this demo, it is almost entirely implemented in the `OnlineServer` script, which contains fewer than 150 lines of code. Even so, it reaches this size mainly because of some additional features, such as displaying server or client information on the screen, etc. Everything is achieved using Cave Network classes for both the server and client.

The key architectural difference in an online game is the use of a player template. Although the player's logic is simple and almost identical to offline examples, there is one critical distinction: a variable called `HasControl`. This variable determines whether the player's logic is executed on that machine. In other words, it decides if pressing W, A, S, and D in that instance will move the character. This is essential because the same player template is used for other connected players, and we don't want all players responding to every control inputâ€”only the corresponding player. Beyond this, the logic remains almost identical.
