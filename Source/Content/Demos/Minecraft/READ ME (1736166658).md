# Voxel World (Minecraft)

This demo is a small, simplified clone of the famous game **Minecraft**. The main goal here is not to create an exact copy of the game but to demonstrate some specific features of Cave Engine, particularly **real-time 3D mesh generation and the use of Perlin Noise** for various applications, including procedural map generation.

In order to play, open the "Minecraft" scene and press F5. You will see that the entire scene is generated "in game", that is: outside of game mode the scene will appear "empty".

For this demonstration, we implemented a straightforward approach to transforming a 3D voxel world into a **Mesh** rendered on the screen, similar to how games like Minecraft do. In the Scripts folder of this demo, you will find three types of components:

- **Voxel Player Controller**: This is essentially a first-person controller for the character and the camera, similar to what you'll find in the first-person game example. Here, the player can move the character using WASD, jump, run, and control the camera with the mouse. The only addition is that the player can aim and add or remove blocks depending on where they are pointing.

- **VoxelChunk**: Responsible for creating the 3D mesh and storing the voxel state for each chunk of the map. A chunk is a predefined-sized section of the game map that contains a mesh representing it visually and in the game's physics, as well as information about each block added or removed.

- **VoxelSpawner**: This component is attached to the player, and as the player moves through the 3D world, it adds voxel chunks near the player, following a specific grid to ensure all chunks align with each other. This is necessary to ensure the world generates dynamically as the player explores. Once a chunk is added, it won't be added again, allowing the player to customize and build or remove elements from them.

# Simple Minecraft Implementation
As mentioned earlier, this is a simple implementation of what Minecraft could be.

The reason for this is that the VoxelChunk component, while generating the mesh and performing some optimizations (e.g., not generating faces of blocks completely hidden by others), does not optimize individual faces. For instance, if two blocks are next to each other and their faces are visible, those faces will not be merged into one, which could potentially make the game's rendering lighter.

Even so, the result is satisfactory for this demo, and you will see that Cave renders everything without any issues.
