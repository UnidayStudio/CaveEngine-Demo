# Welcome to Cave Engine!

Welcome to **Cave Engine**! If this is your first time using it, this quick guide will walk you through the basics. **Cave Engine** is a small but powerful and easy-to-use 3D game engine, scriptable in Python. It allows you to create any kind of 3D game you can imagine—whether it’s first-person, third-person, top-down, fixed camera, racing games, real-time strategy, or something entirely unique.

# Editor Overview
The Cave Engine editor is composed of multiple tabs. Here are the main ones:

- **3D View**: Displays the 3D space you are currently working on.
- **Scene Graph**: Shows all the entities that make up the currently active 3D space.
- **Asset Browser**: Lists all the assets, files, and folders in your project.
- **Console Tab**: Displays messages, errors, warnings, and other logs.
- **Properties Tab**: Shows editable properties for the selected scene, entity, or asset.
- **Settings Tab**: Allows control over specific aspects of your game in general.

You’ll discover additional tabs as you explore the engine.

# Understanding Projects and Assets
A **project** in Cave Engine is essentially a collection of assets, which you can find in the Asset Browser. These assets can represent:

- **3D Meshes**: The geometric models for your game.
- **Textures**: Images that give surfaces detail.
- **Materials**: Define the appearance of meshes by combining textures and shaders.
- **Scenes**: Used to compose the levels of your game.
- **Entity Templates**: Modular blueprints for creating entities like enemies, collectibles, or props.
- **Audio Files**: For music and sound effects.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts to add logic to your game.

# Scenes, Entities, and Components
A **scene** is one of the most important parts of a game, as it represents a game level. In Cave Engine, scenes are built using **entities** and **components**:

- **Entities**: The building blocks of your scene. An entity can also have child entities, forming a hierarchy.
- **Components**: Add functionality to entities. Examples include:
  - **Transform Component**: Defines position, rotation, and scale in 3D space.
  - **Mesh Component**: Gives the entity a visible, renderable appearance.
  - **Light Component**: Makes the entity behave as a light source.
  - **Rigid Body Component**: Enables interaction with the physics world.
  - **Logic Related Component**: Allows Python scripting for custom behavior.

# 3D View Controls
To effectively handle and manipulate your scenes in **Cave Engine**, it's essential to understand how to navigate and interact within the 3D view. Here's how:

## Camera Navigation
- **Rotate Camera**: Hold the **right mouse button** and move the mouse, similar to controlling a camera in a first-person game.
- **Move Camera**:
  - **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, right.
  - **Q, E**: Move up and down.
- **Adjust Speed**: Use the **mouse scroll wheel** to increase or decrease movement speed. Additional speed and mouse sensitivity settings are available in the drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the 3D view.

## Entity Selection and Manipulation
- **Select Scene**: Left-click the **background** of the scene to open its properties in the **Properties Tab**.
- **Select Entity**: Left-click an entity to select it and open its properties in the **Properties Tab**.
- **Toggle Gizmos**:
  - **W**: Activate the move gizmo.
  - **E**: Activate the rotate gizmo.
  - **R**: Activate the scale gizmo.
- **Snapping**: Hold **CTRL** to toggle snapping for precise movements.
- **Duplicate Entity**:
  - **SHIFT+D**: Duplicate the selected entity.
  - **ALT + Drag Gizmo**: Create a copy of the entity while dragging with the move, rotate, or scale gizmo.
- **Delete Entity**: Press **DELETE** to remove the selected entity.

## Creating Entities
- **Add New Entity**: Press **SHIFT+A** to open a pop-up for creating a new entity at the mouse's location. Select from various types:
  - **Folder**: An entity with no components.
  - **Empty**: An entity with only a transform component (Blender-inspired!).
  - **Mesh**: An entity with transform, mesh, and rigidbody components.
  - **Other types**: Include light, camera, or custom templates.

## Advanced Manipulation
- **Position on Surface**: 
  - Select an entity, hover the mouse over a surface in the 3D view, and press **G** to move the entity to the hovered position.
  - Use **ALT+G** to duplicate the entity and place the copy at the hovered position.

With these controls, you'll have full mastery over the 3D view and can efficiently create, manipulate, and fine-tune your scenes.

# Scene Graph and Entity Management
The **Scene Graph** is a powerful tool in **Cave Engine** for managing the hierarchy and organization of entities in your scene. Here’s how to use it effectively:

## Parent-Child Relationships
- **Create a Parent-Child Relationship**:  
  Drag and drop an entity onto another entity in the Scene Graph. The dragged entity becomes a **child** of the entity it’s dropped on. This is useful for grouping and organizing entities.
- **Remove Parent**:  
  Right-click an entity and select the option to **remove parent** to detach it from its parent.

## Entity Context Menu
Right-clicking an entity in the Scene Graph provides several options:
- **Rename Entity**: Change the entity’s name.
- **Toggle Activity**: Enable or disable the entity.
- **Remove Parent**: Detach the entity from its parent.

## Modifying Components

1. **Select an Entity**:  
   - Left-click the entity in the **3D View** or **Scene Graph**.
2. **Edit in Properties Tab**:  
   The entity's properties appear in the **Properties Tab**, including its components.
3. **Manage Components**:  
   - **Edit**: Modify individual components as needed.  
   - **Delete**: Remove a component entirely.  
   - **Add New Component**: Use the **Add Component** option to attach new functionality to the entity.

## Entity Properties
Entities have several properties that make them flexible and powerful:

- **Tag System**:  
  Tag entities for easy identification and management (e.g., "Player," "Enemy," "Item").
- **Custom Properties**:  
  A Python dictionary system for mapping keys to values. This is ideal for entity-specific settings, such as a player’s health or enemy behavior parameters.
- **Other Settings**:  
  Access additional settings tailored to the entity's role or behavior.

By mastering these tools, you’ll be able to organize and customize your game’s entities with ease, ensuring efficient workflow and design flexibility.



# Playing and Testing Your Game
One of the most crucial aspects of **Cave Engine** is its ability to simulate and test your game directly from the editor. Here's how you can do it:

## Starting and Stopping the Game

- **Start Simulation**: Press **F5** to start the game simulation.  
- **Stop Simulation**: Press **F5** again to stop the simulation.

When you stop the simulation, the engine reloads the project to its original state before you started the game.

## Editor Controls During Simulation
While the game simulation is running, the editor controls are disabled by default, meaning you cannot interact with the editor interface. However, for debugging purposes, you can toggle editor controls on and off:

- **Enable Editor Controls**: Press **F3** to enable interaction with the editor. This allows you to:
  - Select entities.
  - Move objects.
  - Inspect and modify properties.

- **Disable Editor Controls**: Press **F3** again to disable interaction with the editor.  
  Note: Even with editor controls enabled, the game continues to run and respond to inputs.

This workflow ensures you can test your game seamlessly while still having the ability to debug and make real-time adjustments when needed.
